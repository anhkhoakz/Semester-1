## Security Policy for Projects

At our university, we take security seriously. To ensure the safety and security of all projects, we require the following security measures:

### Use Strong Passwords

All accounts used for the project should have strong passwords with a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should be changed regularly and never shared with others.

### Limit Access

Access to the project should be limited to only those who need it. This includes both physical and digital access. All accounts should have the minimum level of access necessary to complete their work.

### Use Encryption

Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Encryption should be used for data stored on local machines, servers, and any other location where data is stored.

### Regular Backups

Regular backups should be performed to ensure that data is not lost in the event of a security breach or other disaster.

### Follow Best Practices

Best practices for secure coding and development should be followed. This includes using secure coding techniques, validating input, and properly handling errors.

### Regular Vulnerability Assessments

Regular vulnerability assessments should be performed to identify any weaknesses in the project's security. Vulnerabilities should be remediated as soon as possible.

### Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan should be in place in the event of a security breach. The plan should include steps to contain the breach, investigate the incident, and notify affected parties.

### User Awareness Training

All team members should receive user awareness training on security best practices. This includes training on password management, phishing attacks, and social engineering.

### Regular Updates and Patching

All software used for the project should be kept up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

By following these security measures, we can ensure that all projects developed at our university are maintained with strong security practices.
